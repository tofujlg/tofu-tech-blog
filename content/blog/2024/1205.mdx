## Main

I’ve been working on my React Native app project for over two months now. I’ve spent all my free time outside of work on this app, and I still haven’t released the Android version yet.  
Coding has been pure fun for me. It allows me to explore different technologies that I can’t use in my job and dive deeply into topics I care about. However, the process of releasing the app to the App Store and Play Store has been overwhelming and time-consuming. The Play Store's "20 tester" issue, in particular, is brutal.  

## Released First Version on App Store

Surprisingly, the production release process for the App Store was much easier and faster than that of the Play Store. When there was an issue with my submission, Apple reached out to me promptly with accurate advice on how to fix it. The App Store Connect UX is far better than the Play Store Console.  
I’m not one of those Apple enthusiasts, but I have to admit the experience was much smoother than Google’s.  
When my first app was released on the App Store, it felt incredibly satisfying. Although the app isn’t yet as polished as I want it to be, seeing users download and use my app has been something truly special.  

This month, I updated the app’s UI multiple times. I removed some screens, added new buttons, and rethought the design.  
At work, I typically just implement the logic that the BA, designer, or someone else has already decided on. While I occasionally suggest or discuss UX ideas, it’s never been my primary role. In this project, however, I have to handle everything myself, and it’s been both fun and challenging.  


## Focusing on One Thing

This project has reminded me how important it is to focus on one thing at a time. That’s when I produce my best work.  
Overall, I’m really enjoying what I’m doing right now.
